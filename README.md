I will use data for Happiness report in 2020 and 2021 === Ratings on happiness around the world relies on the Gallup World Poll, an annual survey conducted in more than 160 countries covering 99 per cent of the world's population. Also, covid datasets are used --- Data collected on dates from Mar 2020 to May 2022 by web scraping by a programmer on the Internet. Both datasets are attached as cvs documents. 

My main goal is to examine The correlations between happiness scores, six factors in the happiness report(levels of GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom, and corruption) and covid factor from the covid dataset. Also, I will examine the region differences in scores and Happiness report comparison for 2020 and 2021.
